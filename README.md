# Introduction

This repository contains the data and code used for the publication "Seasonal variation in SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the Netherlands, 2020-2022: statistical evidence for a negative association with temperature", by Klinkenberg et al. (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.28.24318154).


## How to use the code?

Save the repository in your local environment and open it as an R Project in RStudio. By opening the file "Report_TablesFiguresManuscript.Rmd" and running it in order, all analyses are carried out and all output is created and saved. The files in the directory R/ contain the code for the analyses themselves. The directory data/ contains all data used for the analyses.


-   The repository was created with the following version of R and packages
